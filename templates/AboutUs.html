        The National Gallery of Modern Art is Indiaâ€™s premier art institution for modern and contemporary Indian art. 
        The museum was established in 1954 with the singular aim of promoting and preserving modern Indian art. 
        Its vast collection chronicles the trajectory of art in India from mid-18th century to the present.
        NGMA is spread over eight acres of prime space in the heart of New Delhi at the prestigious India Gate Hexagon. 
        The collection is showcased in Jaipur House, the former palace of the Maharaja of Jaipur. 
        The regal ambience of the heritage structure offers a befitting backdrop for the masterpieces on display while 
        sprawling green lawns and courtyards offer a ready stage for a sculpture garden. 
        The new wing constructed in 2009 increased display area with new gallery floors, an art shop, auditorium, preview theatre and library.

        The success of NGMA as a cultural hub has led to the establishment of regional centres in Mumbai and Bengaluru. 
        Here the emphasis is on artistic innovation and promoting excellence in the field of art and curatorial practices. 
        Indigenous art and culture is given special focus as it is believed to be vital in reshaping the cultural landscape of the nation.
